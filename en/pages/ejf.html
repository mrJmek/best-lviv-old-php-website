<p>One of  the aims of the BEST is to create opportunities for students development and support them in reaching their full potential. We try to achieve this aim by organizing Job Fairs, where students, employers, university representatives and members of our organization are gathered in one place.</p><br />
<p><strong>Engineering Job Fair (EJF)</strong> is an event which gives young people an opportunity to communicate directly with company representatives and ask them about possible internship, vacancies or to find a desirable job directly on the Fair. From the other side, employers have an exceptional opportunity to meet qualified young specialists with innovative ideas, who are open to communication, training and development.</p><br />
<p>Therefore BEST Lviv has been organizing EJF for students of <a target="_blank" href="http://lp.edu.ua/en">Lviv Polytechnic National University</a> and young specialists for five years in raw, since autumn 2007. In a short time for one or two days the 4th building of Lviv Polytechnic turns into a "smithy", where every student becomes a blacksmith of own happiness. Looking back at EJF history many leading Ukrainian and international companies with lots of good offers for graduates and students took a part in the event. 6,000 people attended EJF in 2011 and the number of visitors is growing every year.</p><br />
<p>Organisers and companies create interesting and intense schedule. Every year, during the fair, students have a chance to attend presentations, workshops, engineering competitions and sessions on proper CV writing, or to communicate with representatives of companies.</p><br />
<p>A brand new  initiative at previous EJF was a comprehensive training program "Path to Success", within which three workshops were organised on leadership, self-motivation and emotional intelligence. Two meetings with successful people were also carried out, where Technical Director of IT company N-iX Ivan Pesin and CEO of Microsoft Ukraine Dmytro Shymkiv shared experiences with curious young people. As a previous years experience showed, students are very interested in such meetings, they attentively listen to the stories and advises of people who are following their dreams and know how to make them come true.</p><br />
<p><strong>EJF organisers</strong> are constantly working on the improvement of event and its promotion among students.</p><br />
